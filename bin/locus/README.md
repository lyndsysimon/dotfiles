# Lyndsy's Helper Scripts for Locus Health

Scripts in this directory are executable, and should be usable by other team members by default.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyndsysimon/dotfiles.git ~/.lyndsys_dotfiles
source ~/.lyndsys_dotfiles/bin/locus/lyndsys_scripts_install
```

The scripts will be installed as of the next time you open a Terminal window.

To update the scripts, run:

lyndsys_scripts_update
```
